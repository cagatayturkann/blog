I graduated in Computer engineering with both a bachelor's and master's degree. Over the past 5 years in the tech industry, I've worked in various sectors, including travel and finance. However, my primary focus has been on AI chatbot projects. I spent 2.5 years as a business analyst and the rest as a software developer, refining my skills and expertise in this specialized field. Currently, I am thrilled to be a software developer at Juphy, contributing to exciting and innovative technology projects, particularly in the realm of AI chatbots.
