    "content": "Modern AI Technologies and Node.js Integration Introduction Artificial intelligence technologies, especially language models, are rapidly transforming the software development world. Integrating AI technologies with a popular platform like Node.js offers incredible opportunities for developers working in the JavaScript ecosystem. In this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how to implement modern AI concepts within the Node.js framework.\nThis article will help you:\nUnderstand AI terminology and fundamental concepts Integrate LLM (Large Language Model) with Node.js Understand creating AI agents and tool calling capabilities Use open-source AI technologies (Ollama, LiteLLM, LlamaCPP) in Node.js applications AI integration with N8n for automated workflows You can access the complete code for the projects at GitHub repository.\n1. AI Agents: Developing Intelligent Assistants What is an AI Agent? AI agents are software systems designed to perform specific tasks using LLMs (Large Language Models). These agents possess human-like thinking, decision-making, and interaction capabilities. An AI agent is an autonomous software component designed to perform specific tasks. These agents:\nReceive input: For example, queries from users or data from systems. Process: Analyze this data, make decisions, or run models. Provide output: Execute results or actions. Modern AI agents typically include these components:\nLLM (Brain): Natural language understanding and generation capability Memory: Ability to remember past interactions Tools: Ability to interact with APIs, databases, and other systems Planning: Ability to break complex tasks into subtasks AI Agents can be reactive, meaning they don\u0026rsquo;t collect data, analyze environment, etc. without any user trigger, or they can be autonomous, which is more common. An autonomous agent, for example in a smart home system, can continuously monitor the environment, detect specific conditions, and make its own decisions. Such an agent continuously collects data from sources like sensors, analyzes this data, and independently initiates or adjusts certain tasks based on this analysis.\nCreating an AI Agent with Node.js Let\u0026rsquo;s create a simple autonomous agent example using Node.js and OpenAI API. In this example, the agent generates \u0026ldquo;sensor data\u0026rdquo; at specific intervals and acts according to the decision it receives from OpenAI. First, let\u0026rsquo;s install the required package.\nnpm install openai Then our code is as follows:\nconst { OpenAI } = require(\u0026#39;openai\u0026#39;); // OpenAI configuration: Add your API key here const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: \u0026#39;your-api-key\u0026#39;, }); // Autonomous agent function async function autonomousAgent() { console.log(\u0026#39;Agent started working...\u0026#39;); // Step 1: Simulate sensor data (e.g., a random number) const sensorData = Math.random() * 100; console.log(\u0026#39;Sensor data:\u0026#39;, sensorData); // Step 2: Send prompt to OpenAI for decision based on sensor data const prompt = `Sensor data: ${sensorData}. Return a single word \u0026#34;Alarm\u0026#34; if the value is greater than 50, or \u0026#34;Normal\u0026#34; if it\u0026#39;s 50 or less.`; try { const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({ model: \u0026#39;gpt-4o-mini\u0026#39;, messages: [{ role: \u0026#39;user\u0026#39;, content: prompt }], max_tokens: 10, temperature: 0.3, }); const decision = response.choices[0].message.content.trim(); console.log(\u0026#39;Agent Decision:\u0026#39;, decision); // Step 3: Take action based on OpenAI\u0026#39;s decision if (decision === \u0026#39;Alarm\u0026#39;) { console.log(\u0026#39;Alarm condition detected, initiating necessary actions...\u0026#39;); // Here you can add actions like triggering alarms or sending notifications } else if (decision === \u0026#39;Normal\u0026#39;) { console.log(\u0026#39;Situation normal, in standby mode...\u0026#39;); // Additional actions for normal state can be added here } else { console.log(\u0026#39;Unknown decision, rechecking...\u0026#39;); // Error handling for unexpected situations } } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#39;Error occurred:\u0026#39;, error); } } // Run the agent automatically every 30 seconds setInterval(autonomousAgent, 10000); // Run the program once immediately when it starts autonomousAgent(); Let\u0026rsquo;s explain this code in more detail:\nSensor Data Generation: The agent generates a random number each time it runs. This number is considered as sample sensor data. Decision Process: The generated sensor data is sent to OpenAI API within a prompt. This prompt asks to return either \u0026ldquo;Alarm\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo; based on the data. Action: The response from OpenAI determines the agent\u0026rsquo;s decision. If the response is \u0026ldquo;Alarm\u0026rdquo;, the agent performs actions that trigger the alarm state; if \u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo;, it remains in standby mode. Autonomy: The agent works independently at regular intervals (here every 30 seconds) without user intervention, evaluating sensor data and making decisions automatically. This example demonstrates the concept of an autonomous agent as a structure that is not dependent solely on user input, self-triggering, and making decisions based on specific conditions. Thus, the system can take action based on environmental data while working independently in a specific time cycle.\nAI Agent Working Principle AI agents typically follow these steps:\nThinking: Creating a plan for the requested task Tool Selection: Deciding which tool to use to complete the task Action: Performing a specific action using the selected tool Observation: Examining the result of the action Progress: Starting a new thinking-action cycle based on the result This approach is known as ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) and enables LLM to combine thinking with action.\nWhy is This Feature Important? You can delegate automatable operations to intelligent assistants You can provide a more natural interface to human users You can simplify complex workflows with modular tools 2. Embedding, RAG, VectorDB Embedding Embedding is the process of converting text or other data types into numerical vectors. These vectors represent the semantic features of the data in numerical format. For example, the words \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; are represented by vectors close to each other, while \u0026ldquo;car\u0026rdquo; is represented by a more distant vector.\nEmbeddings are used for:\nCalculating text similarity Document classification Semantic search Creating recommendations Sentiment analysis Text summarization Natural language processing tasks The working principle of embeddings is as follows:\nTokenization: Text is first divided into smaller pieces (tokens) Vector Transformation: Each token is converted into a vector of hundreds or thousands of dimensions Normalization: Vectors are normalized to make them comparable The most important feature of embeddings is that content with similar meanings is positioned close to each other in vector space. This allows for meaning-based results in text-based searches rather than word matching. For example, the words \u0026ldquo;happy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;joyful\u0026rdquo; are positioned close to each other in vector space, while the word \u0026ldquo;sad\u0026rdquo; is located at a distant point.\nRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) RAG is a technique that enriches the existing knowledge base of large language models (LLM) with external sources. The RAG system works as follows:\nRetrieval:\nDocuments or information related to the user question are retrieved from the database Most relevant content is found using semantic search Documents are ranked by embedding similarity Augmentation:\nFound information is added to the prompt sent to LLM Information is arranged by order of importance Context window is optimized Generation:\nLLM generates response using enriched context Response can reference given sources Reliability score can be calculated Advantages of RAG:\nUse of current information Increased accuracy Customized responses Reduced hallucinations Traceability of sources Dynamic information update capability Domain-specific knowledge integration Vector DB Vector databases are specialized database systems for storing embedding vectors and performing similarity searches on these vectors. Unlike traditional databases, they can quickly calculate similarity between vectors.\nVector DB Core Features:\nEfficient storage of high-dimensional vectors Similarity-based search (cosine similarity, euclidean distance) Fast nearest neighbor queries Scalability CRUD operations Metadata filtering Batch processing support Vector indexing Vector DBs are particularly used in these areas:\nSemantic document search Recommendation systems Image and audio similarity analysis Natural language processing applications Face recognition systems Anomaly detection Cross-modal search (text-to-image, image-to-text) Popular Vector DB solutions:\nPinecone: Fully managed, scalable solution Weaviate: Open source, self-hosted option Milvus: High-performance, distributed architecture Qdrant: Rust-based, fast and lightweight ChromaDB: Python-focused, ideal for getting started 3. Tool Calling: Adding New Capabilities to AI What is Tool Calling? Tool calling is the ability of an AI model to call external functions or APIs. This allows AI to perform operations beyond its knowledge boundaries.\nModern LLMs have the ability to make tool calls in JSON format. This allows the model to define the action it wants to perform and the necessary parameters.\nTool Calling with Node.js Let\u0026rsquo;s implement tool calling using the OpenAI API. In the example below, we\u0026rsquo;re creating an agent that demonstrates the concept of \u0026ldquo;tool calling\u0026rdquo; using Node.js. This agent calls two different \u0026ldquo;tools\u0026rdquo;:\nWeather API (OpenWeatherMap): The agent retrieves current weather data for a specific location. OpenAI API: Using the weather data it receives, it requests a brief analysis of how the day is going. By using these two tools sequentially, we can see how the agent collects data from external sources and processes this data.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s install the required libraries\nnpm install axios openai Örnek kodumuz ise aşağıdaki şekilde.\nconst axios = require(\u0026#39;axios\u0026#39;); const { OpenAI } = require(\u0026#39;openai\u0026#39;); // Enter your API keys const WEATHER_API_KEY = \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your-api-key\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; // Your OpenWeatherMap API key // Location to query weather for const LOCATION = \u0026#39;Istanbul\u0026#39;; // OpenAI configuration const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your-api-key\u0026gt;\u0026#39;, }); // Step 1: Function to call Weather API async function getWeatherData(location) { try { const response = await axios.get( `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${location}\u0026amp;appid=${WEATHER_API_KEY}\u0026amp;units=metric` ); return response.data; } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#39;Weather API error:\u0026#39;, error); return null; } } // Step 2: Function to send data to OpenAI API and get analysis async function analyzeWeather(weatherData) { if (!weatherData) return \u0026#39;Could not retrieve weather data.\u0026#39;; // Create prompt based on weather data const prompt = `Currently in ${weatherData.name}, the weather is ${weatherData.weather[0].description} and temperature is ${weatherData.main.temp}°C. Based on this weather, how is the day going and what kind of activity would you recommend? Give a brief summary.`; try { const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({ model: \u0026#39;gpt-4o-mini\u0026#39;, messages: [{ role: \u0026#39;user\u0026#39;, content: prompt }], max_tokens: 60, temperature: 0.7, }); return response.choices[0].message.content.trim(); } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#39;OpenAI API error:\u0026#39;, error); return \u0026#39;Weather analysis failed.\u0026#39;; } } // Main function: Calls tools in sequence async function main() { console.log(\u0026#39;Starting Tool Calling Agent...\u0026#39;); // Call tool to get weather data const weatherData = await getWeatherData(LOCATION); console.log(\u0026#39;Received Weather Data:\u0026#39;, weatherData); // Send data to OpenAI API and get analysis const analysis = await analyzeWeather(weatherData); console.log(\u0026#39;Analysis Result:\u0026#39;, analysis); } main(); Bu örnekte, agent \u0026ldquo;tool calling\u0026rdquo; yaparak iki farklı dış kaynağı (OpenWeatherMap ve OpenAI) kullanıyor. Öncelikle hava durumu verisi toplanıyor; ardından bu veri, bir analiz için OpenAI API\u0026rsquo;sine gönderiliyor. Böylece, ajanın kendi yeteneklerinin ötesinde dış kaynaklardan faydalanması sağlanıyor.\nFarklı Araç Türleri AI sistemlerinize entegre edebileceğiniz bazı araç türleri:\nVeritabanı İşlemleri: Veri sorgulama, ekleme, güncelleme API Çağrıları: Harici servislere bağlanma (hava durumu, borsa, haberler) Dosya İşlemleri: Dosya okuma, yazma, dönüştürme Hesaplamalar: Karmaşık matematiksel işlemler Takvim/Zamanlama: Etkinlik oluşturma, hatırlatıcı ayarlama Tool Calling Best Practices Açık Tanımlamalar: Araçlarınızı açık ve net tanımlayın, parametreleri dokumentasyon içerisinde detaylandırın Güvenlik Kontrolleri: Kullanıcı girdilerini doğrulayın Graceful Failure: Araçlar hata verdiğinde zarif bir şekilde geri dönüş yapın Aşamalı Geliştirme: Önce basit araçlarla başlayın, sonra karmaşıklığı artırın 4. Conversation Memory: Adding Memory to AI What is Conversation Memory? Conversation memory is the ability of an AI system to remember previous interactions and respond accordingly. This feature ensures that the conversation is consistent and contextual.\nWhy is it Important? Provides contextual consistency. Users don\u0026rsquo;t need to provide context every time. That is, during dialogue, the agent \u0026lsquo;remembers\u0026rsquo; previous messages. Thus, information given at the beginning of a conversation ensures that subsequent responses are more meaningful and consistent. AI can reference previous requests Provides more natural and human-like interactions Here\u0026rsquo;s an example usage of conversation memory. A chatbot keeps the user\u0026rsquo;s name, areas of interest, or previously asked questions in its memory and references this information in subsequent responses. Thus, each message becomes connected and the conversation gains a natural flow. This memory is usually implemented by storing a certain portion of previous messages. Language models use this historical information as input to produce responses with a better understanding of context. Effective use of conversation memory brings challenges such as memory size and maintaining information currency in long dialogues. As a result, conversation memory is a critical component for AI Agents to produce more \u0026lsquo;intelligent\u0026rsquo; and contextual responses. This feature allows for long and meaningful conversations.\nConversation Memory with Node.js Below is an example of a chatbot that maintains conversation memory. In this example, each user\u0026rsquo;s chat history is stored in MongoDB and we send the history as a prompt to OpenAI when a new message arrives.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s install the required libraries:\nnpm install mongodb express openai Here\u0026rsquo;s our example code:\nconst express = require(\u0026#39;express\u0026#39;); const { MongoClient } = require(\u0026#39;mongodb\u0026#39;); const { OpenAI } = require(\u0026#39;openai\u0026#39;); const app = express(); app.use(express.json()); const OPENAI_API_KEY = \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your-api-key\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; const MONGO_URI = \u0026#39;mongodb://localhost:27017\u0026#39;; const DATABASE_NAME = \u0026#39;conversationDB\u0026#39;; const COLLECTION_NAME = \u0026#39;conversations\u0026#39;; // OpenAI configuration const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY, }); // MongoDB connection const client = new MongoClient(MONGO_URI, { useUnifiedTopology: true }); let conversationCollection; client .connect() .then(() =\u0026gt; { const db = client.db(DATABASE_NAME); conversationCollection = db.collection(COLLECTION_NAME); console.log(\u0026#39;Connected to MongoDB.\u0026#39;); }) .catch((err) =\u0026gt; console.error(\u0026#39;MongoDB connection error:\u0026#39;, err)); // Chat endpoint app.post(\u0026#39;/chat\u0026#39;, async (req, res) =\u0026gt; { const { userId, message } = req.body; if (!userId || !message) { return res.status(400).send({ error: \u0026#39;userId and message are required.\u0026#39; }); } try { // Get user\u0026#39;s previous chat history let conversation = await conversationCollection.findOne({ userId }); if (!conversation) { conversation = { userId, messages: [] }; } // Add user message to history conversation.messages.push({ role: \u0026#39;user\u0026#39;, content: message }); // Convert conversation history to prompt let prompt = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; conversation.messages.forEach((msg) =\u0026gt; { prompt += (msg.role === \u0026#39;user\u0026#39; ? \u0026#39;User\u0026#39; : \u0026#39;Agent\u0026#39;) + `: ${msg.content}\\n`; }); prompt += \u0026#39;Agent:\u0026#39;; // For agent\u0026#39;s response // OpenAI API call const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({ model: \u0026#39;gpt-4o-mini\u0026#39;, messages: [{ role: \u0026#39;user\u0026#39;, content: prompt }], max_tokens: 100, temperature: 0.7, }); const agentReply = response.choices[0].message.content.trim(); // Add agent response to history conversation.messages.push({ role: \u0026#39;agent\u0026#39;, content: agentReply }); // Save updated conversation to MongoDB (upsert) await conversationCollection.updateOne({ userId }, { $set: { messages: conversation.messages } }, { upsert: true }); res.send({ reply: agentReply }); } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#39;Error processing chat:\u0026#39;, error); res.status(500).send({ error: \u0026#39;Server error\u0026#39; }); } }); app.listen(3000, () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;Server running on port 3000.\u0026#39;); }); Example cURL request:\ncurl --location \u0026#39;http://localhost:3000/chat\u0026#39; \\ --header \u0026#39;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#39; \\ --data \u0026#39;{ \u0026#34;userId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;123\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;what\u0026#39;s the temperature in Istanbul\u0026#34; }\u0026#39; Here\u0026rsquo;s how an example scenario might develop: User =\u0026gt; What\u0026rsquo;s the temperature in Istanbul today? Agent =\u0026gt; It\u0026rsquo;s 23 degrees and sunny in Istanbul User =\u0026gt; What about Izmir? Agent =\u0026gt; It\u0026rsquo;s 26 degrees and sunny in Izmir.\nThe agent maintains history here, so in the second question, even though words like \u0026rsquo;temperature\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;weather\u0026rsquo; aren\u0026rsquo;t mentioned, just from the \u0026ldquo;what about Izmir?\u0026rdquo; query, it knows to provide weather information because it maintains the conversation history.\n5. Model Context Protocol: Managing LLM Context Model Context Protocol (MCP) refers to specific rules and configurations about what information should be provided to a language model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet), in what format, and how. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore the following topics to better understand this concept.\nDefining and Formatting Context What is Context =\u0026gt; Language models rely solely on the input (prompt) sent to them when generating responses. This input can include various elements such as conversation history, system instructions, user questions, and even data obtained from tool calls. What is Protocol =\u0026gt; The term protocol refers to the rules that determine how this information will be organized, ordered, and formatted. For example, OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s ChatGPT model separates chat history with \u0026lsquo;system\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;user\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;assistant\u0026rsquo; roles. This structure determines which information the model will prioritize.\nConversation Memory and Context Management Conversation Memory =\u0026gt; Conversation memory is a mechanism that enables remembering previous messages. However, the model doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly store state; context is provided by adding previous messages to the prompt each time. Token Limit =\u0026gt; Models have a limit on the total number of tokens they can process. Therefore, decisions such as which past messages to include and which information to summarize are handled within the scope of \u0026ldquo;model context protocol\u0026rdquo;. This ensures the model sees the most relevant information.\nDynamic and Static Information Dynamic Information =\u0026gt; Information that is continuously updated during conversation (e.g., user messages, responses from tools) is added to the prompt as part of dynamic context. Static Information =\u0026gt; There may also be some system instructions, fixed commands, or information that specify how the model should behave. For example, requesting the model to respond in a specific tone or language.\nApplication Example Let\u0026rsquo;s say we\u0026rsquo;re creating a chatbot. MCP in this chatbot project could work with this logic:\nSystem Message =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;This is a customer support chat. Provide your answers in a polite and helpful tone.\u0026rdquo; User Messages =\u0026gt; Past messages like \u0026ldquo;Hello, I have an issue with my account\u0026rdquo; Tool Calls =\u0026gt; If data is being retrieved from external APIs, this data is also included in the prompt appropriately Prompt Creation =\u0026gt; All this information is combined in a specific order and format (e.g., User: \u0026hellip;, Agent: \u0026hellip;) and sent to the model to generate a response. In summary, MCP serves as a guide that determines what information will be given to the language model, how this information will be structured, and how the model will produce more effective responses. Creating a proper protocol helps the model better understand context and provide more consistent, relevant answers. This concept is particularly critical in long and complex dialogues for keeping the right information within the model\u0026rsquo;s comprehensible limits.\n6. Fine-tuning: Customizing LLMs Fine-tuning is the process of customizing a pre-trained language model (LLM) for a specific task or domain. This process ensures that the model produces more accurate and consistent responses for a particular use case.\nWhen to Use Fine-tuning? Fine-tuning is particularly useful in these situations:\nTasks requiring specific domain knowledge Outputs requiring consistent format or style Situations requiring brand voice and tone alignment Technical terminology usage Multiple similar task repetitions Fine-tuning Advantages Better Performance:\nMore accurate answers in domain-specific tasks More consistent output format Reduced hallucinations Cost Optimization:\nAbility to use shorter prompts Less token consumption Faster response times Customized Behavior:\nResponses aligned with brand language Consistent tone and style Ability to learn specific rules Fine-tuning Process Data Preparation:\nCollecting training data Data cleaning and formatting Creating prompt-completion pairs Model Selection:\nDetermining base model Adjusting model parameters Selecting training strategy Training:\nHyperparameter optimization Monitoring training metrics Cross-validation checks Evaluation:\nModel performance analysis A/B tests Human evaluation Fine-tuning Best Practices Data Quality:\nUse high-quality training data Ensure data diversity Create balanced data distribution Model Selection:\nChoose appropriate model size for task Consider cost-performance balance Evaluate base model performance Training Strategy:\nApply gradual fine-tuning Prevent overfitting Conduct regular evaluation Deployment:\nImplement model versioning Set up performance monitoring mechanisms Create feedback loop 7.
